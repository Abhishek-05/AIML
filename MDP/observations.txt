From the path.png it is event that when the world is stochastic the action need not be the one that leads to the goal(shortest path) because the other actions also have some non zero probabiliy. But finally in order to maximize the reward it needs to land in the goal state as in that way only it can earn some non zero reward according to the reward system implemented. When the value of 'p' increases the world becomes less stochastic and more deterministic as the probability of executing the action that leads to the goal(shortest path) increases. This can be seen evidently form the plot.png where as the value of p increases the number of actions decreases because it becomes more and more deterministic.
